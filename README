EXPERIMENTS WITH BROWSER LOCALSTORAGE

Me, fooling around with localStorage.

The idea was top have a slim wrapper around localStorage that will keep track of the keys in use as well as the updated and creation time of keys.

It might turn out to be a pointless product, but the journey is more important that the destination.
